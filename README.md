# STACK

I present to your attention my project: STACK!

It is a pyramid-based data storage method.

### Let`s see how it works!

1. First of all, You need to init Your stack by command ``` StackCtor``` with args: Stack_t *stack_data_pointer*, size_t *initial_capacity_of_stack*.
2. Then You can ```StackPush``` with args: *stack_data_pointer*, *element_to_push*.
   - You can also ```StackPop``` with args: stack_data_pointer. It is if You want to pop Your data from top of stack.
3. In the end, You need do show the computer that you have stopped using the stack and you no longer need it (that is, delete the memory allocated for it). Use ```StackDtor``` with arg *stack_data_pointer* to do it

Great! Now You know all commands!

> [!WARNING]
> Here are fitches, take a look!!!

This stack is protected from modification by intruders. It contains security measures such as canaries, hash counting, and data initialization verification.

That`s all what I want to say to You about this project.

Good Luck!
